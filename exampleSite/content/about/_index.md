👋🏻 Welcome to my blog! I'm Aditya Dhawle, and I love sharing insights about technology, innovation, and efficient workflows. I have a deep passion for skating, learning new languages, playing chess, engineering, and programming. This blog is designed to be minimal, clean, and distraction-free—just like the tools I use. If you enjoy my content, feel free to explore more and reach out with any suggestions or ideas!
